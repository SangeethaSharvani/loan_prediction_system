# loan_prediction_system

Developed a machine learning model to predict loan approval outcomes based on applicant details and financial history. The project involved end-to-end data handling including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends and patterns in demographic, income, credit history, and loan-related features using Pandas and Seaborn.

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries. Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Created new meaningful features such as Total Income, Income to Loan Ratio, and Credit Risk Score to improve model performance.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to ensure fair prediction for both approval and rejection cases.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Achieved high accuracy and F1-score using optimized hyperparameters.

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost, Google Colab.

This model can assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process and making data-driven decisions with improved efficiency and fairness.
